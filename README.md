# 🤖 Reflex Agent in a 2x2 Grid Environment

This project simulates a simple **Reflex Agent** navigating and cleaning a **2×2 grid environment** based on current percepts. It is designed to demonstrate basic AI agent logic using Python, ideal for learning foundational AI concepts.

## 🧠 What is a Reflex Agent?

A **Reflex Agent** makes decisions based only on the current situation — it doesn’t remember the past or predict the future. This notebook visualizes how such an agent would behave in a simplified world of clean and dirty rooms.

---

## 🔍 Features

- Simulates a stateless agent that can clean or move
- Uses `matplotlib` to visualize the environment
- Interactive execution in **Google Colab**
